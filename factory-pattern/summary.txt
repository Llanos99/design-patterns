What does this DP do?

- This simple DP moves the instantiation logic to a separate class.

Use cases:

- Typically this DP is used when there's more than one object that can be created, a simple logic (simple criteria) is used to choose the correct class.
- Simple factory itself doesn't need any state tracking so, it's best to keep this as a static method.

Real examples:

- The Java NumberFormat class has getInstance method which is an example of simple factory.

Pitfalls:

- The criteria used by simple factory to decide which object to instantiate can get more complex over time. In this case it's better to use factory method DP.
