What does this DP do?

- This DP makes existing code object work with client by adapting the object to client's expected interface. Basically this DP wraps existing object.

Use cases:

- When there's an existing functionality, and we need to extend it to supply the clients interface requirements.
- Class adapter may not be possible if both target and adaptee are concrete classes. In such cases, use object adapter.
- Adapts an object to another interface without changing behaviour.

Real examples:

- The InputStreamReader and OutputStreamWriter are examples of object adapters.

Pitfalls:

- How much work the adapter does depend upon the differences between target interface and object being adapted.
- With class adapter you can create objects that exposes unrelated methods in parts of the code.
