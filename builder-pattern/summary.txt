What does this DP do?

- This DP is used to create instances of objects easier without large constructors.
- The DP remove the logic related to object construction from client code.

Use cases:

- v1 is used when there's an inheritance hierarchy for final product. v2 is used when there's no inheritance at all.
- If there's a lot of arguments for a constructor then the builder pattern is the way to go.

Real examples:

- StringBuilder uses the builder DP.
- Calendar class implements builder DP.
- Lombok library provides @Builder annotation to create objects using builder DP.

Pitfalls:

- Kinda complex for new programmers because of the method chaining where builder methods return builder objects itself.
- Possibility of partially initialized object. User can set only few or none of the properties, in the case some required properties are missing, build some default values or throw exception.
